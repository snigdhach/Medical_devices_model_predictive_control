# Medical_devices_model_predictive_control

1. Designed online predictive control to analyse the thermal effect and power consumption of implantable medical devices with an average error of less than 0.13ÂºC.

2. Implemented system identification techniques on the OE polynomial model to determine the numerical values of the model parameters.
